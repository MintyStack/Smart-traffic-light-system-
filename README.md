# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light Control System using Arduino

This project simulates a **smart traffic light controller** that adapts traffic light timings  
based on the **traffic density detected by an ultrasonic sensor**.  
It gives longer green signals when traffic is heavy, and shorter green signals when traffic is light.  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Automatic traffic light sequence (Red → Yellow → Green)  
- **Traffic density detection** using ultrasonic sensor  
- Dynamic **green light duration** based on vehicle count  
- Expandable with **pedestrian crossing button** and **IoT dashboard**  

---

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- Push Button (Pedestrian request)  
- Buzzer (optional)  
- Jumper wires & Breadboard  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add **multiple lanes** with synchronized signals  
- IoT dashboard to monitor traffic in real-time  
- AI camera integration for vehicle detection
